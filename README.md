Now then. It's a wet afternoon and the office is still pretty empty as people enjoy the last few days of their Christmas and new year break.

# First Steps
1. Before you create a new branch, pull changes from the master branch.
2. When you create branches, give them meaningful names.

# Second Steps

1. Create a pull request for a single commit or set of commits.
2. Specify a reviewer for the pull request; this is someone who can judge that commits that you are planning to merge with the master branch.
